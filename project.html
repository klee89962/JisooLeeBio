                <h3>Projects</h3>

                <p>I am a person who might not do perfectly for examination. However, I always aim for A+ quality projects for my classes. For instance, my group and I have revieved 98% in our software engineering project, and was complimented to be one of the best project in the class, our project is called Eventile, an event finder web application. <a href="https://jlee2967.github.io/Eventile/">More description in this link.</a></p>

                <p>Following programs are some of the assignments I worked on to get high marks on.</p>

                <h4>C - Magic Square Program</h4>

                <p>This program prints an n x n magic square (a square arrangement of the numbers 1, 2, ..., n<sup>2</sup> in which the sum of the elements in any row, column, or diagonal is the same). This program should generate a magic square of a specified size n, where user will specify size at run time. Size must be an odd positive integer between 1 and 99.</p>

                <div class="project-code">

                    <pre>
# This program prints a n x n magic square where it is numbers from 1 to n^2 which sum up of elements in any row, coloum, or diagonal is the same. Size of magic square should be the size of n which is inputted by user. */

int main(void)
{
  int n;

  printf("Enter size of magic square: "); /* Prompts user value for size of magic square */
  scanf("%d", &n);

  while ((n % 2) == 0 || n >= 13) /* Checks if n is a valid size */
    {
      printf("Invalid size, try again...\n");
      printf("Enter size of magic square: ");
      scanf("%d", &n);
    }

  int magic_square[n][n], x = n / 2, y = 0, num = 2, x2, y2, i, j;

  for(i = 0; i != n; i++) /* Sets all the values in matrix equal to 0 */
    { 
      for(j = 0; j != n; j++){
    *( *(magic_square + i) + j) = 0;
      }
    }

  *( *(magic_square + y) + x) = 1; /* Sets the middle element of row 0 to 1 */

  while (num != ((n * n) + 1)) /* Checks if there is an attempt to go out of bound. So from row 0, next row won't be row -1, but it will be row n - 1 instead. For coloums, from col n - 1, next row wont be col n,
   but it will be col 0. Program also checks if array is empty (equals to 0). If it is empty, it fills the num in. If it is not empty, it puts the number directly below the previously stored number */
    {
      if (x == (n - 1))
    {
      x2 = x;
      x = 0;
    }
      else

      y = (n-1);
    }
      else
    {
      if(y == (n - 1))
        {
          y2 = 0;
          y--;
        }
      else
        {
          y2 = (y + 1);
          y--;
        }
    }

      if (*( *(magic_square + y) + x) != 0)
    {
      y = y2;
      x = x2;
    }

      *( *(magic_square + y) + x) = num;
      num++;
    }

                <h4>VBA - Sudoku Solution Checker</h4>

                <p>This program checks the numbers on the cells for sudoku board to see if it is correct or not, and gives the rows, columns, and general range with problem if it is wrong.</p>

                <p>The following code will check for the range for sudoku board. It will return boolean value based on the cell values.</p>

                <div class="project-code">

                    <pre>
Function checkRange(rng As Range) As Boolean

    Dim result As Boolean
    Dim found As Boolean

    result = True

    For i = 1 To rng.Count
        found = False

        For Each Cell In rng.Cells
            If Cell.Value = i Then
                found = True
                Exit For
            End If

        If found = False Then
            result = False
            Exit For
        End If
    Next i

    checkRange = result

End Function
                        </pre>

                </div>

                <p>Using this function, every range of cells will need to be checked. Following function (checkAndFormat) will accept range of cells and check to see if range is valid. If invalid, it will change the colour of cell to red. After, the manual input for the cells will be required (checkAll). Like following example.</p>

                <div class="project-code">

                <p>For this program, I have recieved 100% in my assignment for my Data Analytics Course.</p>

                <p>Not only these, I have also excelled in various other assignments. Here are brief description of them.</p>

                <h4>Road Map Path Finder (Course: Data Structure & Algorithms - Achieved Grade: A+)</h4>

                <p>This is a java program where it searches for the path between the starting point to end point. However, there is possibility that path is not available. The challenge for this project is that there could be a toll at the path to the end point, and the user has limited amount of money to pay the tolls. For this program, not only I was able to meet the deadline, I was able to get extra mark for submitting earlier than an actual deadline when many people struggled to submit in time.</p>

                <h4>Simple Database Manager (Course: Data Structure & Algorithms - Achieved Grade: A+)</h4>

                <p>This is a java program where user is able to keep track of the database. Users are able to play/ view any media files. If it is normal text file, program returns text associated with that file. Very basic UI was required to get this program running, also I was required to program classes, which can open/play media files. Same as Road Map Path Finder, I was able to get extra grade for finishing early while others struggled to meet the deadline.</p>

                <h4>Movie Theatre Company Website (Course: Databases I - Achieved Grade: A+)</h4>

                <p>This is a web application created with SQL, Python/Flask, and HTML, which simulates ticket selling system in theatres. Customers can search for movie screenings, buy tickets, and edit their profiles. While Employees can see, track, and edit customer purchase infomrations and movie screenings. Same as two projects I talked about, I was able to earn extra points for finishing early, and bonus grade adding some html designs. Since I am more experienced with HTML/CSS now, I would try to make the web application more appealing to user.</p>

                <p>From these projects, I can say that I am a person who also meets deadline, and exceeds the expectations. I have many other projects where I was able to recieve high marks. To check them out, <a href="https://github.com/kyle782">Click this link</a>.</p>
